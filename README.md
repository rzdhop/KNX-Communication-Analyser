## About

**KNX-Communication-Analyser is a Wireshark-like network frame analyser for KNX objects**, such as blinds, lighting, heating, air conditioning, and even devices connected to door communication using the KNX network. The program is written in C++.

## Features

* View in real time the raw KNX frames in transition in the network.
* Log mode: export to a .txt file the frames transmitted during the execution of the program.

## Startup

To run this program, you will need a PCB (link to ours is below) on which you will place a cable from your KNX bus, and connect it to your computer.  
  
After downloading and installing the package available in the project's Git Releases (<https://github.com/rzdhop/KNX-Communication-Analyser> "KNX-Communication-Analyser download"), and running the KNX-Communication-Analyser, it will recognise whether you need to install one (or more) drivers on your PC.
The software will detect KNX frames and start reading after pressing the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button.

## How to use the graphical version of the KNX Telegram Analyser?
