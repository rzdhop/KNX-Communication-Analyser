## About

**KNX-Communication-Analyser is a Wireshark-like network frame analyzer for KNX objects**, like blinds, lighting, heating, air conditioning, and even door communication connected devices using the KNX network. The program is written in C++.

## Features

* See in real-time raw KNX frames transitioning in the network.
* See the translation of the action. For example "Box n¬∞1 transmits the order to turn on the light n¬∞04"
* Log mode: export in one .md or .txt file the frames and their translation transmitted during the execution of the program.
* Minimized logs mode: the program runs in the background and writes on a file the frames transmitted during the execution of the program.
* (in project) Print selected KNX frames directly from the app.
